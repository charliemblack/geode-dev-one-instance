# Overview

In a production environment it is recommended to deploy Geode in its component pieces to separate concerns.   However in development having multiple processes can be cumbersome for the developer.   Luckily Geode can also be deployed as a single JVM.

This project's intent is to show the user how to launch a Geode Locator, Server and its management components in a single process.
